Sexual Competitiveness

Humans are undeniably competitive in terms of sexual attraction
this translates into a competitveness in appearance - hair, clothing and body shape
clearly not everyone is actively involved in the competition
as in any competition, people do not all put in equal effort to win
instead, those who might conceivably win put in huge effort,
	then there is a rapid falling-off and most of the rest do not compete at all
this is clearly a rational response to a competitive situation
but some people also react badly to a competition, and withdraw, even if they
	have a possibility of winning - an aversion to the "rat race"
hence anti-attractiveness fashions - goth, punk, etc
of course there is also a strong sense of belonging involved, bolstered by
	the camaraderie of a group who have collectively opted out of competition
the impact on obesity is clear too - under an assumption of food plenty,
	the distribution of "effort to stay thin" is not flat, but highly tilted
	towards actively participating in attractiveness competition
it must be stressed that a person doesn't have to be promiscuous or actively
	seeking new sexual partners in order to be engaged in the sexual
	attractiveness competition
people unconsciously assess each others' attactiveness all the time, and
	people are aware of that, and behave accordingly
