I think of myself as British first and English second, and I am concerned that within twenty years, my country will no longer exist.

Worse, since last year's referendum, most people in England seem to have forgotten about the subject and are carrying on oblivious.
Sure the SNP won a landslide in Scotland, but we don't really know what is going to mean, politically, and few seem to really care.

Britain is mow, effectively, a federal country, albeit a haphazard one, and to some extent a reluctant one.
