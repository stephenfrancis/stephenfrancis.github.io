Screen 1

Welcome to PropertyPurchaseApp! I can help you **track your property purchase** and
**provide guidance** throughout the process.

Let's get started!

Which of the following have you done so far?

o Selected your target locatiom and started viewing properties

o Got an "offer-in-principle" from a mortgage company

o Had a verbal offer accepted by the seller

o engaged a solicitor

o had your mortgage agreed

o exchanged contracts

o moved in


[state key benefits up-front, and dive straight in with a relevant question that
will establish context and help the user to begin thinking about the main stages
of the process; each o the above options has 'hover texr' to explain in more detail]


Screen 2

[initial text is a response to previous question]

e.g. if none ticked, "well, it's a bit early to start using me yet, but come back when
you've started looking at properties!"

if "moved in" ticked, "well, it's a bit late for me, but I hope you love your new home!"

if out-of-order options, something like "well, I think you need to get an
"offer-in-principle" from a mortgage company, unlsss you have the full price available as
cash (lucky you!) - let me help you!"

if neither mortgaged agreed nor offer-in-principle, then "I'll suggest some great mortgage
offers in a moment"

if not engaged a solicitor, then "I'll suggest some great solicitors in a moment"

What type of property?

- freehold
- leasehold
- other
- not sure

[capture the most significant detail in terms of predicting offer-to-completion time,
as ewll as being an important fact for later]


Screen 3

Did you know that the average time from offer being accepted to moving in for a freehold/
leasehold property in the UK is NN weeks?

I'll let you know when to expect things to be done by, throughout the process, so you
can have peace of mind that everything is on track!

Just give me your email address, a password, and the postcode of the property you're
looking to buy (if you know it) and I'll be with you every step of the way!
