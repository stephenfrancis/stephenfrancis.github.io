title: An Equal Devolution
---
So now it's the turn of the "English cities" to be the target of the government's devolution
spotlight, owing to the unhappiness of the English about the extent of the powers
being devolved to Scotland, anomalies in Parliament leading to Scottish MPs voting on matters
that don't affect Scotland, and vague perceptions that Scotland is getting an unfair deal.

And that is exactly the problem - each new round of devolution is driven by, and is a reaction
to, immediate political problems, without any thought to the eventual structure of the country
- in short - there is no vision of where devolution is taking Britain.

Of course, devolution to English cities has recently been tried already, by New Labour, to be
greeted by general apathy. It was seen for what it was - a largely superficial addition of
extra elected bodies - Mayors - that would just complicate an already complicated picture of
district, county and unitary councils and national government.

Supposed to provide greater accountability, I think people recognize that incremental
devolution actually creates confusion and complexity that saps accountability and leaves
everybody pointing fingers and everybody else.

But nobody has really spelled this out, because Britain's democratic power structure is not a
matter that gets focus groups buzzing. The devolution achieved so far has been driven by
Scottish, Welsh (and in a more complicated way Irish) Nationalism. Which highlights a second
glaring imbalance: these Nationalisms are respectable, whilst English Nationalism is
synonymous with racism and far-right extremism, and British Nationalism doesn't exist.

British Nationalism disappeared with the dismantling of the British Empire in the 50s and 60s,
and not been replaced by anything obvious that will bind Britain together.

If a way is to be found to keep Britain together, it will be need to demonstrate its own
internal logic. In particular, if the current highly-centralized system is to be decomposed into
separate parts then those parts will have to relate to each other at a federal level if the
whole is to retain any meaning or purpose.

And perhaps the absence of that logic is a cause of the current discontentment. If the majority
of its people genuinely wish Scotland to be fully independent then there is little else to be done,
but an alternative possibility is that Scotland is fed up of being the junior partner in a
union whose dominant neighbour seems to show little interest or respect.

A federal union of equal states with equal powers would solve all these problems. The
boundaries of these states already exist - England has ten regions, which together with Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland could form a federation of 13 units of broadly equal populations,
each with its own assembly, powers to make local laws, set taxes and spend tax revenue in
delivering public services, and promote economic, social and cultural development.

There can be a coherent vision for the future of Britain through an equal devolution -
a Federal Britain.
