title: Brexit

Last Thursday, the UK voted to leave the EU, by 52% to 48%, in a referendum.

Since the result was known, early Friday morning, the country's political system appears engulfed with chaos, the markets have been rocked, and I think there is a rapidly developing sense of uncertainty across the country.

How should we understand this, and what can we learn from it?

The answers are to be found in a set of interlocking themes:
* The Nature of Democracy
* The failures of the Remain Campaign
* The Problems with the EU
* The Weakness of British Identity
