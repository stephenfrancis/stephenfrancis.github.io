title: The Principle of Periodic Equivalence
---


This idea probably already has a different name, but...

Early bankers might have baulked at the idea of Compound Interest, but they would not have had much choice.
After all, a depositing customer could always just withdraw their cash and interest owed, and take it round
the corner to a rival bank.

The behaviour of any long-term financial product must reflect that of the entries into and exits
from a sequence of similar shorter-term products.

Hence the positive exponential of compound interest, and the negative exponential of a repayment mortgage,
which can seem unfair to the borrower, in that, at the beginning, most of each repayment is just interest.

But a mortgage can be regarded as a sequence of loans of gradually decreasing amounts, with the interest
and the repayment amount staying the same. Since those two factors are fixed, but the initial loan amount
reduces, the amount of interest charged must reduce too, and hence the amount of the capital being repaid
increases.

The point is that the structure of the mortgage repayment reflects the theoretical repeated entry/exit
pattern.

The revolving credit facility is another example of the principle.
