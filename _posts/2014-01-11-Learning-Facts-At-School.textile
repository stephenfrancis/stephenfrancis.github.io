title: Learning Facts at School
---
There seems to be an idea in education at the moment that, with the advent of the Internet,
 there is no longer a need for **facts** to be taught or learnt in school.

See, for an example of this view espoused,

The idea rests on some questionable assumptions:
- That our memories are constrained by a fixed amount of "storage" - like those of computers - that shouldn't be needlessly
	filled up with facts that can be found on the Internet only as and when required.
- That the precious hours of the school day can be better devoted to teaching "higher thought" - analysis, reasoning, and
	such like, without particularly needing a reservior of facts to draw upon.
- That in the rest of our lives, our abilities to draw good conclusions and solve tough problems needs only this reasoning
	and analytical ability to sit within our brains - the facts can be retrieved from the Internet again, as and when
	necessary.
