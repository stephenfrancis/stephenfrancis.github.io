title: Militant Islam and Free Speech
---
It struck me recently that there is a deep irony at the heart of the current conflict between
free speech and militant Islam.

The reason that liberals, such as myself, support freedom of speech, even to the point of
causing offence, and the reason that cartoons of Mohammed, etc, are so offensive, is almost
exactly the same.

Both creeds, and others too, contain deep-seated rules for the purpose of self-preservation.

Of the Ten Commandments, the first three all serve this purpose:

* I am the Lord thy God, and thou shalt have no other gods before me
* Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image
* Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain

The first is the statement of identity and obligation to the faith; the third is the
principle of blasphemy, and therefore the repudiation of freedom of speech where it might
threaten the sanctity of the religion.

It is the Islamic equivalent of the second that means Islamic decorative art contains no
representation of any living thing, least of all any image of God or Muhammed, and is why
simply drawing pictures of Muhammed is almost as offensive as the ridicule attached to them.

Like the mechanisms in DNA replication (or computer network protocols) that prevent errors in
copying the code, the fundamental creeds of Christianity, Judaism and Islam all contain rules
whose purpose is to keep the faith pure, and avoid heresy.

In the case of images, this means avoiding the perceived mistake of earlier ages in worshipping
statues and idols.

In the case of liberalism, the self-preserving rule is freedom of speech itself - to ensure
that nothing is "off-limits" for discussion and hence risks becoming an unchallenged orthodoxy,
and thus subverting the liberal tolerance of different creeds.

This perspective should explain the strength of feeling on both sides, and answer questions like:

* "Why be so offended by the cartoons and jokes of unbelievers?", or on the other hand,
* "Why offend large numbers of people just for a joke?"

Humour is an effective way of testing the public boundaries of freedom of speech and even, in
some ways, of carrying forward debate.
