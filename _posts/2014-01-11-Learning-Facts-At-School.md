title: Learning Facts at School
---
There seems to be an idea in education at the moment that, with the advent of the Internet,
 there is no longer a need for **facts** to be taught or learnt in school.

See, for an example of this view espoused,
http://www.standard.co.uk/news/education/tomb-raider-gaming-boss-set-to-open-free-school-which-focuses-on-computer-skills-8979639.html

The idea rests on some questionable assumptions:
- That our memories are constrained by a fixed amount of "storage" - like those of computers - that shouldn't be needlessly
	filled up with facts that can be found on the Internet only as and when required.
- That the precious hours of the school day can be better devoted to teaching "higher thought" - analysis, reasoning, and
	such like, without particularly needing a reservoir of facts to draw upon.
- That in the rest of our lives, our abilities to draw good conclusions and solve tough problems needs only this reasoning
	and analytical ability to sit within our brains - the facts can be retrieved from the Internet again, as and when
	necessary.

In fact, psychological insight into human thinking (see e.g. Daniel Kahnemann's "Thinking Fast and Slow") shows us that thoughts
	and opinions are formed by a process that requires effort, and favours the use of the most available, accessible information
	(i.e. what we can easily remember) over and above data that we may have to go and find.

We don't form views and opinions from blank slates, deciding what appropriate data is required and going to find it on the
	Internet (or wherever), we continually refine our ideas from the facts we know and experiences we have.

Furthermore, our memory is a collection of associations - connected concepts and ideas. Absorbing a new fact requires
	connecting it to related ones - the context. If I learn that Shakespeare wrote his plays during the reign of Elizabeth I,
	knowing detail about the period, e.g. the religious conflict, the growing role of international trade in the economy,
	the recent development of printing, and so on, I gain a much richer insight into the times, the influences on his work,
	their likely reception and impact.

In fact, this context will actually help me to commit to memory more information that I am presented with - I have more
	existing connections to add it to.

Facts are a structure being continually built on as I expose myself to more information in the world, in a process that could
	work exponentially (at least within a range) rather than linearly.

Of course, I need to expose myself to trusted and accurate sources of information as much as possible, wrong facts are still
	wrong facts.

And of course I'm not suggesting that facts are best learnt "by rote" - by repeating words out loud. Like all brain skills,
	memory and recall and best improved by practice - in this case by absorbing information (reading, watching, etc) and then
	having to recall it - writing essays, discussing, etc.

Like most things, memory is best tested and improved through practice - actually trying to recall the information (hopefully)
	committed to memory in realistic circumstances, at varying lengths of time from when it was committed.
