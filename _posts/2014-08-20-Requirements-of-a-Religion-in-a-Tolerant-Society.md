Every religion claims that the truths of existence and moral law have spiritual origins
and are beyond rational challenge.

A liberal, tolerant, secular society is based on the opposite premise - that it can agree
a set of practical moral rules between its members that are derived by rational logic from
a few "self-evident" axioms. These may originate, historically, from religious traditions,
but do not depend any more on any religion's creed, and are open to challenge.

Such a society wants to be open to all, regardless of religion, as well as regardless of
sex, sexuality, or colour of skin. However, unlike those other categories, a person's religion
will affect their beliefs, and hence their ability to accept the foundations of the tolerant
society.

Thus it is possible for a religion to be simply incompatible with a tolerant society. If, for
example, it claims that non-believers have no worth, and it is better for them to be killed
than for them to speak against the relgion or act against its laws, then it cannot be
reconciled with a tolerant society.

To differentiate the religions that can and can't be so reconciled, I propose that each one
should submit to the test that it
