title: Liberalism and Religious Freedom

Some recent news stories...

- A Christian-run bakery in Northern Ireland is under investigation for refusing to fulfil an order for a cake bearing a gay message.
- The EU Supremem Court upholds France's ban on full head coverings - the "Burqa ban", as it is known there.

It might appear that the idea of religious freedom is losing ground in western Europe at the moment.

In the first case, the bakery has been asked, by the NI equality commission, to compensate a customer for discriminating against
him/her in the sale of goods or services on the grounds of his/her sexuality. Yet it appears that it is the message on the cake,
not the customer, that is at issue, and in fact it seems that those who made the decision were probably not even aware of the
sexuality of whoever placed the order.

I don't think this is an academic distinction. To me, it lies somewhere between (say) a Christian bed-and-breakfast refusing to
accommodate a gay couple, a print-shop refusing to produce posters whose pro-gay message the proprietor disagrees, and a singer
refusing a booking to sing songs in such a vein in public - a spectrum of scenarios to which my gut response ranges from
"yes, that should be prevented in law" to "I'm very uncomfortable with that being illegal".

The B&B couple may not like the idea of gay sexual acts occurring under their roof at all, but sex is a reasonable thing for
their customers to engage in, in bed, at night, so refusing to accommodate a gay couple is a direct and immediate form of
discrimination.

Supplying someone with a good or service doesn't, in most cases, involve you in somehow endorsing, or even helping to
promulgate a view you disagree with. However, some businesses do. Running a print-shop, for example, will involve you in
promulgating all sorts of views and messages, and if you felt you needed to agree with them all, you're going to be turning
a lot of customers away. Ordering posters promoting gay views, rights, culture, is a reasonable thing for a print-shop
customer to request, and refusing such an order is surely also a direct and immediate form of discrimination.

Running a bakery, on the other hand, would not obviously fall into this category, and the prospective owners of a bakery might
be forgiven for not anticipating that they would have to produce products that promoted views they were opposed to, even when
they offered a service to writing messages in icing on the cakes.

I am also concerned by the apparent targeting of the bakery - it seems to me that the order might have been placed with the
intention of provoking a confrontation.

I am a liberal, and as such I believe that people should be granted the widest possible freedoms consistent with their not
compromising the freedoms of others. A consequence I see of this is that freedoms a "concentric" - my thoughts do not directly
affect anyone else so I have complete freedom of thought; my private speech affects only those I know, and in a strictly
voluntary way - words cannot force - so I have great (but not complete) freedom of private speech; my public speech can have
greater consequences and must be a little more circumscribed; my private actions may have consequences on others that they have
no control over so more laws must apply to them; and my actions as an employer, or as a seller of goods and services brings me
further into a public realm where I can affect the interests and happiness of others.

In particular, Equality legislation means that, whatever my private views, as a public actor, I must avoid prejudice in regard
to race, gender, sexuality, disability and religion when dealing with others.
